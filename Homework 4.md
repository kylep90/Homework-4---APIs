## Homework 4

I found this homework very difficult. I had 'played' with my code a lot to get it to work.
I had a problem with some of my if statements and not too sure why functions still worked when I 
deleted them.

Everything does work within the code, except I haven't yet added the scored to the local storage, 
which would be the next step for this activity.

# What went well - I was able to loop the questions along with the answers after each time the user
entered their answer.

# Even better if - I could add the local storage.
